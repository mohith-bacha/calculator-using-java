# Calculator project using Java
## Introduction

This project is a simple graphical calculator application developed in Java using the Swing library. The calculator provides a user-friendly interface for performing basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. The design follows a standard calculator layout, allowing users to input numbers and operators sequentially, view the entire expression as they enter it, and then evaluate the result.

## Description

### Project Overview

The calculator application is implemented using Java Swing, a widely used library for creating graphical user interfaces (GUIs). The application features a clean and intuitive interface, where users can perform arithmetic operations using a series of buttons. The calculator is capable of handling multiple inputs and displaying the entire expression in a text field, giving users a clear view of the operations they are performing.

### Key Features

- **Simple and Clean Interface**: The calculator's layout consists of a grid of buttons, representing numbers, arithmetic operators (`+`, `-`, `*`, `/`), an equal sign (`=`) to evaluate expressions, and a clear (`C`) button to reset the calculator.
  
- **Multiple Input Handling**: Users can input complex arithmetic expressions (e.g., `5 + 3 * 2 - 1`) by pressing buttons sequentially. The full expression is displayed in the text field as it is being built, providing real-time feedback to the user.

- **Expression Evaluation**: The calculator evaluates the arithmetic expression when the equal sign (`=`) is pressed. The result is then displayed in the text field, and the expression is reset for the next calculation.

- **Error Handling**: The calculator is designed to handle common errors gracefully. If an invalid expression is entered or an error occurs during evaluation (e.g., division by zero), the text field will display "Error," and the calculator will reset.

### Technical Details

- **GUI Components**: The calculator uses a `JFrame` for the main window and a `JPanel` to hold the buttons in a 4x4 grid layout. A `JTextField` is used to display the current expression and result.

- **Button Handling**: Each button on the calculator is associated with an `ActionListener` that appends the corresponding digit or operator to the current expression. The `=` button triggers the evaluation of the expression.

- **Expression Parsing and Evaluation**: The calculator internally represents the expression as a `StringBuilder` object, which stores the sequence of numbers and operators. The expression is parsed and evaluated using a simple algorithm that processes the expression from left to right, applying the operators in the order they appear.

### Code Structure

- **`Calculator` Class**: The main class that sets up the GUI and handles all user interactions.
  
- **`ButtonClickListener` Inner Class**: Handles button clicks, appending digits or operators to the expression, and evaluating the expression when the `=` button is pressed.

- **`evaluateExpression` Method**: A utility method that parses and evaluates the expression stored in the `StringBuilder`.

## How to Run

To run the calculator application, compile and execute the `Calculator.java` file in a Java development environment or command line. Ensure that your system has Java installed and properly configured.

## Conclusion

This calculator project serves as a practical example of using Java Swing to create a functional and interactive graphical application. The project demonstrates basic GUI design principles and provides a foundation for further exploration into more advanced topics such as handling complex expressions, implementing additional mathematical functions, and enhancing the user interface.
